This assignment implements various exceptions in Java, both checked and unchecked. For each exception, a specific scenario is simulated to trigger the exception. The code includes try-catch blocks to handle the exceptions gracefully. Comments are added to explain the purpose of each code block.

Exceptions Implemented:

Checked Exceptions:

IOException: Simulates reading a non-existent file.
FileNotFoundException: Simulates opening a non-existent file.
EOFException: Simulates reading beyond the file's content.
SQLException: Simulates connecting to a non-existent database.
ClassNotFoundException: Simulates attempting to load a non-existent class.
Unchecked Exceptions:

ArithmeticException: Simulates division by zero.
NullPointerException: Simulates accessing a null reference.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Simulates accessing an invalid array index.
ClassCastException: Simulates an invalid type cast.
IllegalArgumentException: Simulates passing an invalid argument to a method.
